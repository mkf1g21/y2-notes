payload drives design. This is the case in things like intel sats that go in high latitudes to eavesdrop. 
they will need large deployable antennas and orbits that go over the high latitudes for a maximum amount of time

pointing, power and thermal are all there to support the payload's ability to do its mission.
payload resolution will drive orbit selection (finer resolutions need lower orbits for imaging etc)
